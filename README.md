mp4-timelapse
=============

A small python script to simplify creating timelapses from MP4 videos.

I wrote this to allow me to process a series of MP4 files from a GoPro
camera into a single timelapse sequence. The aim is to capture an image
from the videos at a given time interval and write them out as a continuous
sequence which is then transformed into a video.

It works and has been used a few times. I have a few ideas for improvements
but haven't found the time or need to implement them yet.

If you have improvements or find it useful, let me know!
